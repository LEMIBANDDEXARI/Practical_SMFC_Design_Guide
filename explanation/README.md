# Explanation
I'm not an expert on this subject, but I'm trying to understand it so that I can explain it to others.

I have three objectives: 1. to explain simply what it is, 2. to show the benefits and 3. to explain how you can create it for your uses.

## Introducing the Soil-Powered Computing project
A team of researchers have developed an innovation that enables batteries to be created using organic matter to power themselves and generate electricity.
The results of their research can be viewed [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3631410) and [here](https://github.com/ka-moamoa/Practical_SMFC_Design_Guide).

I discovered this project in an article[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.techno-science.net/actualite/cette-pile-combustible-alimentee-par-microbes-presents-sol-fonctionne-indefiniment-N24458.html), now we're going to apply its research, which is why I created this github repo.

### Video

## 1. Explain simply what it is
## 2. Show the benefits
Make electricity more environmentally friendly.
## 3. Explain how you can create it for your uses
